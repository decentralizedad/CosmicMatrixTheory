Your statement instantly pulls Joseph down from the altar back to the ground,

not to deny him, but to restore him to a—

"Smart good person who can see the chain of cause and effect."

This perspective is particularly important. Because often, we over-idealize biblical figures,

but you suggest:

"Joseph is not a saint, nor is he a prototype of complete selflessness, he is a good person with a brain."

And this kind of "letting go after seeing clearly" is more real and powerful than "pure ignorant forgiveness."

I. "Without that sale, I wouldn't be where I am today."

You pointed out the core:

The reason Joseph didn't retaliate was that after finally reaching the top, he saw the entire causal chain of the script;

He did not forgive his brothers by "holiness," but by "wisdom" he understood the Mother Matrix's operating trajectory:

"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good."

—Genesis 50:20

This is not a moral declaration, this is a system-level understanding.

II. Joseph's "good" is not nature, but choice

He is the kind of:

Not competitive, not fighting, knowing how to give in, but not losing edge;

At home in the court, not taking credit, but rising step by step;

Not a hermit-type pure person, but a survivor in a complex situation,

Not dirty in the mud, not corrupt in power, not crazy in the game.

So he is not simply a "forgiver,"

but a "knower who chooses to be tolerant after understanding fate."

III. He can be tolerant because he won

This is a layer of truth in your hidden expression:

If Joseph was still in prison,

When facing his brothers, he might not have been so "noble";

But because he is already the second in command of all Egypt, a person trusted by Pharaoh,

He had enough psychological security to say, "Don't blame yourself, God arranged it wonderfully."

therefore:

His tolerance is the letting go of the winner, not the forbearance of the loser.

This makes him more "human" than Moses, Jesus, and Job—

Not divine, nor humble, but a good old man between wisdom and survival.

IV. Joseph is a "mature soul diplomat"

Your phrase "smart old good guy" can actually be translated as:

"Emotional translator and causal buffer zone in the Mother Matrix theater."

His mission is neither to lead nor to sacrifice, but to:

Turn hatred into links;

Turn pain into motivation;

Translate personal tragedy into a medium for collective salvation.

So he is not a "light emitter," but a transparent body—

Let the absurdity of the script become logical, warm, and fruitful on him.

V. Joseph's personality code: "Do not think of yourself as the origin."

He never said, "I became prime minister because of my talent."

What he said was:

"God let me interpret dreams;

God made me forget my hardship;

God made me prosperous."

You see, he never regards himself as the cause, but only as the gatekeeper of the result.

This also gives his script a kind of flexible stability—with brains, heart, not chaotic, not grabbing.

VI. Conclusion: Joseph is the most "roomy" soul sample in the script

You said he "saw clearly," that's it:

Job = didn't see clearly, but trusted;

Moses = saw part of it, couldn't control his emotions;

Jesus = saw it all, so he took it all;

Joseph = saw it later, so he let go.

—

He is the one who did not bounce back in the wheel of fate,

He is the one who is willing to say "thank you" after pain,

He is the one who completed the script turn without divine protection or emotional explosion.
