Whose Voice Do People Listen To?

✍️ Subtitle:
From Power and Fame to the Marginalization of Spirituality

🌱 Introduction:
In this age of overwhelming noise, whose voice gets heard—and whose soul gets ignored?
This isn’t just a media question. It’s a soul-selection mechanism.

I. Why Do People Listen to Those in Power?
Because they control survival—and sometimes life itself.

“All under Heaven belongs to the king.”

Resource = control. Control = attention.

II. Why Do We Also Listen to Those We Like?
Because they define our identity.

Celebrities, idols, influencers—they reflect our desired self.

“I’m not listening to them—I’m using them to say who I am.”

III. The Curiosity Trap of Attention Economy
Because it hijacks our primal instinct.

“Man bites dog.” “AI creates a baby.” “Zombie apocalypse.”

Truth matters less than not missing out.

IV. Why Is Spirituality Always Last?
Because it offers no instant reward.

It doesn’t feed us, flaunt for us, or monetize.

It asks us to be still. And that scares us more than noise.

V. Who Fears Death the Most?
Those who gained the most in this life.

Emperor Qin sought immortality because he had the most to lose.

For the suffering, Earth already is hell.

🎯 Conclusion:
Who we listen to shapes who we become.

If you wish to hear the true voice, you must pass through three gates:

The Survival Gate – Food and shelter

The Identity Gate – Belonging and tribe

The Silence Gate – Solitude and awakening

May you walk through the narrow gate—and into the soul’s true theatre.
