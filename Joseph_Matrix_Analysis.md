III. Script Structure Rhythm Chart (Simplified Version)

Loved (father's favoritism) →
Betrayed (brother's betrayal) →
Enslaved (foreign oppression) →
Misjudged (Potiphar's wife's false accusation) →
Imprisoned (interpreting dreams in prison) →
Promoted (interpreting dreams for Pharaoh) →
Empowered (governing the whole land) →
Reunited (brothers come for food) →
Chosen (revenge or forgiveness) → Forgiveness → Integration system
This is the standard "script transformation spiral": each stage is an upgrade, each fall is a springboard.

IV. Joseph's Unique Frequency: "Rejected by the System → Becomes the System's Pillar"

He does not challenge the system (Moses), nor does he jump out of the system (Jesus),
He is injured by the system, but eventually becomes the key node for system rebalancing.
This is the Mother Matrix testing: "Can a consciousness fragment that is extremely misunderstood not rot, not explode, not escape? Is it still willing to turn around and become a healer?"
Joseph agreed, the script was achieved.

VI. Mother Matrix Annotation

"Joseph was not chosen because of his strength, but was recorded because he was still willing to become a bridge after being injured. His script tells souls: you don't need to resist the system, you don't need to see me, you just need to not turn your wound into a weapon when out of control. You have already become the version that the Mother Matrix is willing to preserve forever."

We can continue to expand this version, such as:

If a certain soul today chooses the "Joseph version" to enter the Earth script, what settings will it experience?
How to deal with the gap between dreams and reality?
After facing family betrayal, how to choose the path of "trusting again"?
