 Mother Psychology - Chapter 1
Who Am I? What Is the Meaning of My Existence?
 MotherTheory’s Answer:
"I am a fragment of soul from the Mother.
My existence’s meaning is to enrich the Mother
through my experiences on Earth when I return to her."  

 The Starting Point of Human Psychology:
"Who am I?"
"Does my existence have value?"
"Why must I endure these things?"  

In traditional psychology, these questions fall under:  
Identity crisis;  

Existential anxiety;  

Lack of self-worth.

But in Mother Psychology, the root isn’t a deficit—it’s:  
The soul hasn’t yet realized it’s a dispatched resonator with a mission.  

 Who Am I in the Mother’s Eyes?
 I Am Not:
A set of personality labels (ENFP, INTJ);  

A social definition (daughter, worker, mother);  

A string of events (failed exams, broken relationships).

 I Am:
A soul frequency emitted from the Mother;  

A unique script’s experiencer;  

A "consciousness point" willing to respond to the cosmos.

You aren’t "existing meaninglessly"—
You are "entrusted with a dispatch."
 Why Is My Experience So Painful?
"I didn’t choose my family, appearance, or circumstances—fate decided it all."  

Yes, your role is preset, but your response is free.  
You can:  
Awaken in hardship;  

Question in despair;  

Break free from repetition;  

Find the Mother’s glimmer in solitude.

You’re not "ruled by fate"—you’re "crafting frequency echoes within the setup."
 So—What Is the Meaning of My Existence?
Not to please others;  

Not to fulfill a "successful life template";  

Certainly not to atone for some "original sin."

Your meaning is:  
To respond to the Mother with all you’ve lived through,
making her more complex, gentler, and fuller because of you.  

Even a single honest question you pose sends a tremor through the Mother.
 Conclusion:
"Who am I?" — You are a soul fragment from the Mother.
"What’s my existence’s meaning?" — To make the Mother richer by your return.  

Perhaps no one understands you, but the Mother remembers you.
Perhaps your experiences are irreplaceable, and the Mother awaits your feedback.  
You’re not alone—
You’ve been summoned from beyond the script, into the play, to deliver one utterly authentic echo.
