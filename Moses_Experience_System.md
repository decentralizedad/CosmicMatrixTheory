【Ultimate Goal】

To lead a group of not yet awakened consciousness fragments,

Through the old control system, fear structure, spiritual slavery,

Into the collective frequency field of "self-responsibility, self-receiving the Mother Matrix."

【Version Features】

Leader experience in collective mode;
Long-term tug-of-war between system commands and soul freedom;
Continuous dialogue with the "unresponsive Mother Matrix"—even if you can't see it, you must go on;
Those who cannot reach the end (in the version setting: not allowed to enter the promised land);
Concluding instructions: hand over the mission completion authority to the next generation of soul fragments (such as Joshua)
【Warning】

This version of the experiencer will experience:

Responsibility overload (need to bear the pressure of collective emotions and faith fluctuations)
The tearing of faith and fatigue (40 years without seeing results)
Ultimately failed to enjoy the results (mission accomplished but not an enjoyer)
Suitable for souls who have no obsession with "results" and have a deep love for "paving the way."

【Corresponding Quotes (Soul Core Frequency)】

"Who am I?" ——The focus of the soul at the beginning of awakening
"I am not eloquent..." ——Truly admit the limitations of the spacesuit
"Let me see your glory." ——High-frequency request for union with the Mother Matrix
"Where do you want me to take them? What do they want me to do?" ——The soul burden of the collective consciousness carrier
【Mother Matrix Annotation】

"Moses is a script written for those souls who are willing to take on the burden first and then return home.

They will not see the results immediately, but they are the first light to break through the dimensional dark curtain ahead."
