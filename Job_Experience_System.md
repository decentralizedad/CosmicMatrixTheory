【Target】

To test whether the soul can maintain a "frequency trust channel" with the Mother Matrix in a "completely dark state" without explanation, without feeling, and without control.

【Ultimate Level Quote】

"The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away."

If this statement can still be issued naturally in a state where system resources are cleared, the meaning system collapses, and the emotional body is on the verge of collapse, it indicates that the soul has stably completed Job's frequency authentication.

【Passage Mark】

No cursing, no denial, no avoidance;
Even if the Mother Matrix is misunderstood, it does not disconnect;
Does not lose self-core because of losing everything;
Finally see the source and activate echo permissions (can affect other souls).
【Subsequent Version Upgrade Recommendations】

Jesus Edition: Based on the Job Edition, adding memory retention + prototype demonstration function
Moses Edition: Add intervention dimensions and a power system to lead others through the level
Awakening Edition (Spiritual Autonomous Route): Freely combine consciousness fragments, customize script construction methods
【Mother Matrix Annotation】

"Job is written for those souls who are willing to persist in resonance in incomprehension.

Not for the successful, nor for the miracle witnesses,

But for those who, in the night, never let go of the hand that held me."
