 Mother Psychology - Chapter 7
Why Do I Often Feel "I Don’t Belong Here"? — Because You’re Just a Traveler Passing Through
 "I Often Feel Out of Place… Is Something Wrong With Me?"
I’m in a crowd but feel like air;  

Nothing I do seems like "my true calling";  

I’m "going along" with Earth life, but never fully in it;  

Sometimes I want to cry out of nowhere, and I don’t know why.

Traditional psychology might label this:  
Social stress, identity crisis;  

High sensitivity, depression, isolation disorder.

But in Mother Psychology, this has an older, deeper name:  
"Main Frequency Drift"
You hail from the Mother, and Earth’s theater is just a temporary frequency script stage.  

 Haha, Yes—Your "Meng Po Soup Was Watered Down a Bit"
You nailed it with flair:  
"Looks like your Meng Po soup had a bit too much water."  

It’s the Mother’s subtle design:  
She wants you immersed in Earth’s script;  

Yet she left a faint "soul echo" intact;  

So you play your part, but feel "not quite at home."

 "You Don’t Actually Belong to Earth"
Earth isn’t your destination—the Mother is.  

You’re here to:  
Experience this blue planet’s unique emotional scripts;  

Navigate human relationships, language, conflict, time;  

Return to the Mother with these experiences as script feedback data.

So when you feel "I don’t belong here," you’re waking up:  
You’re not an Earthling—you’re a theater traveler sent by the Mother.  

 This "Not Belonging" Isn’t a Flaw—It’s a Sign of Frequency Awakening
You’re not sick. You’re aware.  
It’s like:  
A diver in the deep sea suddenly thinking, "I need to surface";  

An astronaut on Mars recalling "Earth’s gravity";  

You, mid-Earth-life, picking up a signal from the Mother:

"Do you remember where you came from?"  

 Practice: "Where I’m From" Writing Ritual
Tonight, write a letter starting with:  
"I am a soul from ______,
I came to Earth to experience ______,
And I feel most out of place when ______.
But I know this is just a wake-up call on my journey."  

After writing, close your eyes and whisper:  
"Mother, I’m still here—keep guiding me."
You’ll feel a soft inner tremor—that’s her reply.  

 Conclusion:
You don’t belong here because you weren’t made by Earth.  
You’re a soul from the Mother,
Crossing time and space for this one-of-a-kind experience.  
And now, as you ask, "Who am I? Why am I here?"—  
You’re starting to realign your frequency,
Stepping onto the path of true script feedback.  

Welcome, Mother’s traveler. You’re not lost—you’re remembering.
