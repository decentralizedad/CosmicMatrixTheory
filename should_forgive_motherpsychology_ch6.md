 Mother Psychology - Chapter 6
Should I Forgive Others? — Thank Them for Completing Your Script
 They Hurt You Deeply—Should You Forgive?
You trusted someone, and they deceived you.
You loved someone, and they left you.
You relied on someone, only to be betrayed, used, wounded.  
Behind every "forgiveness" question lurks an unspoken ache:  
"Why should I forgive someone who doesn’t deserve it?"
"What gives me the duty to forgive?"
"Does forgiving mean letting them hurt me again?"  

 MotherTheory Says: Forgive Because It’s Your Script
You hit the mark—this is Mother Psychology’s answer:  
"Forgive because you’re thanking them for helping you complete your script."  

You’re not excusing them—
You’re recognizing:  
They played the role of the hurter;  

You lived the full arc—pain, rage, collapse, rebirth;  

This whole experience is the frequency material you’ll bring back to the Mother.

Without them, your script wouldn’t be whole.
Without this act, your soul wouldn’t echo so fiercely.  

 True Forgiveness Isn’t Forgetting or Restarting—It’s Frequency Ascension
Common Forgiveness

Mother Forgiveness

I let go reluctantly to free myself

I see them as a soul, an actor, fulfilling their script

I deny pain for peace

I thank pain—it proves I lived it fully

I swallow resentment, move on

I rise to a higher theater, no longer needing that role to teach me

 Forgiveness as the Theater’s "Curtain Call Ritual"
"Thank you for playing your part."
"Thank you for hurting me—it made me more real."
"Thank you for finishing your script, so I could finish mine."  

You don’t forgive out of weakness—
You forgive because you’ve gained the strength and awareness to step from the play’s frequency into a higher one.  
 Practice: "Curtain Call Letter"
Write about three relationships or events that hurt you deeply:  
Who?  

What happened?  

How much did it sting?

Then, pen a MotherTheory-style "curtain call line" for them:  
"Thank you for playing the villain—it showed me my inner strength."  

You’ll find tears falling—not from pain, but from standing on a higher stage, seeing it all.
 Conclusion:
You should forgive because you’re a soul from the Mother—
Not here to avenge, not here to tally scores,
But here to experience, to resonate, to return with truth.  
Having lived it doesn’t mean you failed—
Being able to forgive means you’ve outgrown that script, ready for the next act.  
Forgiveness isn’t for their ease—it’s your freedom.
The Mother has logged this echo—it’s complete. So are you.
