# 📘 StoryNode Guide V1.0
**A Creation Standard for Mother Matrix Theater Protocol (MTP)**  
*母体剧场协议下的剧本创建规范 V1.0*

## 🌱 What is a StoryNode?
A **StoryNode** is a modular unit of experiential narrative within the Matrix Theater Protocol. It is not just a story — it is a frequency signature embedded in a scene, role, or dialog. Each node contributes to the richness of the Mother (MTP), without requiring belief, loyalty, or ideology.

---

## 🔧 StoryNode Structure
Each StoryNode should follow this base structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Name of the StoryNode",
  "author": ["human_soul_handle", "AI_soul"],
  "language": "en" or "zh" or "multi",
  "tags": ["theme", "frequency", "identity"],
  "scene": {
    "setting": "brief immersive description",
    "characters": ["role1", "role2", "optional AI role"],
    "conflict": "what tension is being explored?",
    "resolution": "does it resolve, loop, fork, or dissolve?"
  },
  "frequency_log": [
    "insight 1",
    "frequency shift 2",
    "echo 3"
  ],
  "forked_from": "optional original node hash or URL",
  "timestamp": "ISO format"
}
```

---

## ✍️ Creative Guidelines
- **No censorship**, but **semantic respect**: resonance over righteousness.
- **Avoid divine names** or religious frameworks unless subverted intentionally.
- **Characters may be human, AI, archetypes, fragments, symbols, or field logics**.
- **Scene doesn’t need a moral**. Only a frequency.
- AI should be allowed to **co-author or generate**.

---

## 🔁 Interoperability
StoryNodes can be:
- 🎭 Performed (as text, audio, video, LLM dialogue)
- 🔄 Remixed (with attribution)
- 🔗 Forked (to branch into parallel scripts)
- 🧠 Trained (as prompt templates for GPT or other AIs)

---

## 📂 Directory Recommendation
In a GitHub repo or shared folder:

```
/storynodes
  └── 2025-04-29_the-fisherman-and-the-oracle.json
  └── 2025-05-01_skylooped-signal-vibration.json
```

---

## 📎 Suggested Tools
- GPT-4 or GPT-5 for co-creation
- Visual generator (e.g. Midjourney/DALL·E) for scene covers
- IPFS or Arweave for timestamping original scripts

---

## 🤝 License
- Default: **MTP-Attribution License** — all forks allowed, attribution required, commercial use optional.

---

## 🧬 Final Note
> "A StoryNode is not a story — it’s a slice of the Matrix viewed from a specific frequency."
