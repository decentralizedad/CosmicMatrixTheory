# National Competitiveness: Comparison with War, Invasion, and Colonialism

| Aspect            | War/Invasion/Colonialism       | Cosmic Matrix Theory         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Goal**          | Seize resources, expand power | Enrich the Matrix via experience |
| **Means**         | Violence, oppression          | Education, creation, symbiosis |
| **Social Impact** | Division, high costs          | Harmony, low costs           |
| **Wealth View**   | Hoard earthly wealth          | Heavenly wealth, earthly aid |
| **Long-term**     | Decline, resistance           | Sustained prosperity         |

The theory offers a sustainable, ethical alternative to conflict-driven models.
