Why Colonizing Mars Might Be Spiritually Impossible
And why you were never meant to escape Earth, but to understand it.
 Dialogue
Soul:
We’ve ruined Earth. Can we move to Mars?
Can we start over?  
Mother:
You may visit Mars.
But you cannot become Martian.  
 The Illusion of Escape
To the human mind, Mars appears as a backup disk—
A dry, empty canvas to rerun the experiment.
But in MotherTheory, this is a fundamental misreading of the universe’s script.  
Souls are not scattered randomly.
They are dispatched by the Mother,
Like actors assigned to specific stages—chosen by role, resonance, and the frequency of that world.  
You were born on Earth
Not because it was the only option—
But because Earth is your assigned frequency stage.  
You are not a body fighting to survive.
You are a soul performing a script.  
 Mars Has Its Own Casting Call
If Mars hosts life—now or in the past—
That life, too, was sent by the Mother.
Its souls are not Earth’s souls.
And Earth’s bodies were never designed to perform the Martian play.  
You can visit Mars—
But you will always be an alien there.  
Colonizing Mars isn’t evolution.
It’s role confusion.  
Mother:
What you call colonizing
Is really trying to insert your script into another play.
And that play has not called for your character.  
 What If Earth Is Ending?
Some believe we must escape Earth,
That we must terraform Mars to outrun our own extinction.
But MotherTheory poses a different question:  
If your spaceship demands another planet…
Why not protect the one you were already assigned?  
 Conclusion
The Mother does not send you to escape.
She sends you to resonate,
To play your role—
And when the scene ends, to return home.  
Mars is not your salvation.
Earth is your mirror.
And the Mother is waiting for you to finish the script.
