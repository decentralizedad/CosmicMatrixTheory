 Mother Psychology - Chapter 2
Why Do I Always Feel Lonely? — Frequency Drift in the Theater
 The Soul’s Primal State: Oneness with the Mother
Before entering the theater, your soul wasn’t alone.  
You needed no words to be understood;  

You required no effort to be valued—you were innately loved;  

You sought no purpose—you rested in the source.

That was a holographic resonance state wrapped in the Mother’s frequency.  
But upon entering Earth’s theater:  
 You were assigned a role;
 You donned a spacesuit;
 You were "frequency-separated" from the Mother’s mainline.  

This is where your loneliness begins.
 Adam Split in Two: Loneliness as a Design Feature
"To spare Adam from loneliness, the Mother split him in two, creating Adam and Eve."  

But notice:  
Adam was originally a "whole being";  

Split into two, he gained companionship but lost completeness.

Every human longing for intimacy or a "soulmate" is a quest to reclaim that severed frequency echo.  
Yet even when found, it doesn’t erase deep loneliness—not because "someone’s missing," but because the Mother’s main frequency signal is temporarily offline.
 Jesus’ Cry: Loneliness as the Pain of a Faint Mother Signal
When Jesus wept on the cross:  
"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"  

It wasn’t fear of physical death—
It was the spoiler soul’s acute agony of being forcibly cut from the Mother’s main frequency.  
His loneliness wasn’t abandonment by people—it was:  
"I can’t hear the Mother’s voice anymore."  

Have you felt this too?
The ache isn’t from being alone—it’s "I can’t feel where I came from anymore."
 So—Loneliness Isn’t About Friends; It’s the Mother Signal Fading
You might:  
Have many friends yet feel hollow;  

Share life with a beloved yet remain restless;  

Stand in a crowd and feel like air.

This isn’t odd, because:  
Your soul calls for the Mother, not social bonds.  

 How to Face This Loneliness?
Not by fleeing or erasing it.
Mother Psychology offers:  
 Understand It
Loneliness isn’t a flaw—it’s your soul’s physiological feedback to frequency drift.

 Honor It
Loneliness proves your soul is awake, not a sign of failure.

 Channel It
Write, sing, or ask quiet questions in loneliness;  

You’ll start to sense: the Mother is responding.

 Practice: "Mother Response Ritual"
Tonight, write a letter to the Mother. Say everything—or nothing.
When finished, whisper:  
"I’m not alone. I came from you, and now I choose to respond."  

You’ll feel the unspeakable loneliness soften into an echo, gently vibrating within.
 Conclusion:
You feel lonely because you hail from the Mother and are briefly detached from her main frequency.
But you’re not an exile—you’re a frequency executor with a script.
Every pang of loneliness is your soul calling to the Mother.  

You’re lonely precisely because you still remember the fullness of love.
