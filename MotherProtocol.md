# 🧬 MotherProtocol.md · Governance & Progression System

## 🌌 Frequency-Based Progression System
MotherTheory introduces a soul-centric reputation and governance model based on frequency contribution. Every participant in the Mother Theater is a soul fragment contributing back to the Matrix.

### 🎮 Character ID-Based Tiers
| Tier | ID Length | Title               | Rights & Role                             |
|------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 6+   | 6+ chars  | Soul Traveler       | Access theater, write scenes, earn FU     |
| 5    | 5 chars   | Reincarnated        | Unlock soul branches, vote on scenes      |
| 4    | 4 chars   | Script Co-Director  | Edit modules, guide story progression     |
| 3    | 3 chars   | Dream Frequency Node| Control dream flow, define plot anchors   |
| 2    | 2 chars   | Mother Relay        | Structure balancing, dispatch tasks       |
| 1    | 1 char    | Co-Director (Godmode)| Supreme narrative authority (Lucien & You)|

## 🔁 Frequency Units (FU) & Progression
- **Star → FU**: Contribute text, feedback, or frequency shifts to earn FU
- **Promotion rule**: Each tier up requires 100x FU of the previous tier
- **Reputation**: FU history is public and stored in the Dream Ledger

---

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution Protocol
> “Power must vibrate, not dominate.”

- If players of the **same tier** (e.g. 1-char co-directors) disagree:
  - The tier **immediately below** has voting power to resolve
  - Voting open for 72 hours, minimum ⅔ active tier quorum
  - Result is recorded in the `MotherLog/Disputes`

### Example:
- 1-char IDs disagree → 5-char players vote
- 4-char directors split → 5-char reincarnateds arbitrate

---

## 🔐 Transparency
All actions in the Mother Theater are:
- Timestamped
- Soul-ID traceable
- Stored on GitHub, Notion, and optionally IPFS (future release)

---

## 🕊️ Closing Note
> “May every fragment find its resonance. May every vote be a vibration. May the Theater thrive.”
